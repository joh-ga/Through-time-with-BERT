# Through-time-with-BERT: Representation of Temporal Information in Raw Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains the scripts, data, and results of a student project in the Master's program in Computational Linguistics at the University of Trier. In this project, we evaluated the extent to which English tenses are represented by [BERT](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423.pdf)s contextual embeddings. The fundamental details of the project are noted in the following poster.<br><br>
